# Wise Publishing Frontend Challenge üë®‚Äçüíª

This challenge is meant to measure your capabilities as a **senior frontend developer** and assess your approach to solving complex frontend problems. We value clean architecture, attention to performance, and good user experience.

We appreciate adherence to **SOLID**, **KISS**, and **DRY** principles and encourage a focus on performance, **Core Web Vitals (CWV)**, and UI/UX skills.

### Frontend Expectations ü§ò

1. **Performance:**
   - **Optimize for Core Web Vitals (CWV):** Ensure the app scores well on metrics like First Contentful Paint (FCP), Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
   - **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading of job postings and images to improve initial load time.
   - **Minification and Compression:** Minimize and compress assets (CSS, JS) for better performance.

2. **UI/UX:**
   - **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is fully responsive across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
   - **User-friendly Filters:** Implement an intuitive filtering UI with clear feedback when users apply filters.
   - **Microinteractions:** Add subtle animations or transitions to improve the user experience without impacting performance.
   - **Accessibility:** Ensure the site is accessible for all users (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support).

3. **Frontend Architecture:**
   - **Reusable Components:** Build reusable components for job cards, filter options, and forms using Blade and Alpine.js.
   - **Separation of Concerns:** Ensure a clean separation between data fetching and UI rendering for scalability.
   - **CSS Architecture:** Use a CSS methodology such as BEM or utility-first CSS for maintainable and scalable styles.

4. **Extras (Optional but appreciated):**
   - **Dark Mode Toggle**: Provide a dark mode toggle for the job board.
   - **Hosting**: Deploy the application for extra points.
